# scientifica

> Tall and condensed bitmap font for geeks.

`scientifica` is largely based on
[`creep`](https://github.com/romeovs/creep), with a number of
minor tweaks to improve readability (*a matter of taste of
course*). Most characters are just 4px wide, which is brilliant for
low dpi(90-120) displays.


## What's new?

 - Scaleable `ttf` format
 - Raster formats: `otb` and `bdf`
 - Ligatures (vim and neovim only)
 - **Bold** and *Italic* variants
 - New Characters to the following unicode blocks:
   * Geometric Shapes
   * Arrows
   * Miscellaneous Technical
   * Miscellaneous Symbols
   * Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A
   * Private Use Area (Powerline symbols)
   * Mathematical Operators
   * Box Drawings
 - Revamped characters: `V, *, f, W, M, ~, & , i, t, a, (), [], {}`
 - Vertically centered operators
 - Larger Brackets to ease recognizability in streams of text
